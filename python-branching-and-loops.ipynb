    "\n",
    "This tutorial is an executable [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org) hosted on [Jovian](https://www.jovian.ai). You can _run_ this tutorial and experiment with the code examples in a couple of ways: *using free online resources* (recommended) or *on your computer*.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Option 1: Running using free online resources (1-click, recommended)\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to start executing the code is to click the **Run** button at the top of this page and select **Run on Binder**. You can also select \"Run on Colab\" or \"Run on Kaggle\", but you'll need to create an account on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) or [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com) to use these platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Option 2: Running on your computer locally\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the code on your computer locally, you'll need to set up [Python](https://www.python.org), download the notebook and install the required libraries. We recommend using the [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/) distribution of Python. Click the **Run** button at the top of this page, select the **Run Locally** option, and follow the instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    ">  **Jupyter Notebooks**: This tutorial is a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org) - a document made of _cells_. Each cell can contain code written in Python or explanations in plain English. You can execute code cells and view the results, e.g., numbers, messages, graphs, tables, files, etc., instantly within the notebook. Jupyter is a powerful platform for experimentation and analysis. Don't be afraid to mess around with the code & break things - you'll learn a lot by encountering and fixing errors. You can use the \"Kernel > Restart & Clear Output\" menu option to clear all outputs and start again from the top."

    "\n",
    "One of the most powerful features of programming languages is *branching*: the ability to make decisions and execute a different set of statements based on whether one or more conditions are true.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The `if` statement\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, branching is implemented using the `if` statement, which is written as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "if condition:\n",
    "    statement1\n",
    "    statement2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `condition` can be a value, variable or expression. If the condition evaluates to `True`, then the statements within the *`if` block* are executed. Notice the four spaces before `statement1`, `statement2`, etc. The spaces inform Python that these statements are associated with the `if` statement above. This technique of structuring code by adding spaces is called *indentation*.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Indentation**: Python relies heavily on *indentation* (white space before a statement) to define code structure. This makes Python code easy to read and understand. You can run into problems if you don't use indentation properly. Indent your code by placing the cursor at the start of the line and pressing the `Tab` key once to add 4 spaces. Pressing `Tab` again will indent the code further by 4 more spaces, and press `Shift+Tab` will reduce the indentation by 4 spaces. \n",

    "The conditional expression highlights an essential distinction between *statements* and *expressions* in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Statements**: A statement is an instruction that can be executed. Every line of code we have written so far is a statement e.g. assigning a variable, calling a function, conditional statements using `if`, `else`, and `elif`, loops using `for` and `while` etc.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Most expressions can be executed as statements, but not all statements are expressions. For example, the regular `if` statement is not an expression since it does not evaluate to a value. It merely performs some branching in the code. Similarly, loops and function definitions are not expressions (we'll learn more about these in later sections).\n",
    "\n",
    "As a rule of thumb, an expression is anything that can appear on the right side of the assignment operator `=`. You can use this as a test for checking whether something is an expression or not. You'll get a syntax error if you try to assign something that is not an expression."

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* This process is repeated till the condition becomes false, which happens when `i` holds the value `101`. Once the condition evaluates to `False`, the execution of the loop ends, and the `print` statement below it is executed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Can you see why `result` contains the value of the factorial of 100 at the end? If not, try adding `print` statements inside the `while` block to print `result` and `i` in each iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> Iteration is a powerful technique because it gives computers a massive advantage over human beings in performing thousands or even millions of repetitive operations really fast. With just 4-5 lines of code, we were able to multiply 100 numbers almost instantly. The same code can be used to multiply a thousand numbers (just change the condition to `i <= 1000`) in a few seconds.\n",

    "You can check how long a cell takes to execute by adding the *magic* command `%%time` at the top of a cell. Try checking how long it takes to compute the factorial of `100`, `1000`, `10000`, `100000`, etc. "
